# Spark

`plpipes` provides an integration layer for Spark/Databricks via the
package `plpipes.spark` and also a set of database backends and
drivers for using the Spark DB engine as a regular database.

## SparkSession

SparkSession setup is performed using a set of drivers, which handle
different environments.

Currently, the supported drivers are as follow:

- `embedded`: initializes a Spark environment without any external
  infrastructure. Once the Python program ends, the Spark system also
  shuts down.

- `databricks`: connects to a remote Databricks cluster using
  [`databricks-connect`](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-connect/python/index.html).

Every driver accepts a different set of configuration options which
are described below.

### Usage

```python
from plpipes.spark import spark_session

spark = spark_session()
...
```
